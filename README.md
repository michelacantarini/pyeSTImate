# pyeSTImate
A python-based tool for the *speech transmission index* prediction.
## Description
PyeSTImate is a predictive tool of speech transmission index in room acoustic environments, representing an extension of the room impulse response (RIR) simulator included in the software package *pyroomacoustics* [1]. It aims to calculate the speech transmission index (STI) of a room without recourse to direct measurements of the RIRs, which are simulated based on the room geometry, materials, furniture, type of occupants, and positions of source and receivers. After calculating the reverberation time (RT) at the listening points, the average STI is determined by the indirect method according to UNI 11532-1:2018 [2] and IEC 60268-16:2020 [3], and the evaluation procedures of UNI 11532-2:2020 [4].\
PyeSTImate consists of two main blocks: the first, based on *pyroomacoustics*, returns simulated room impulse responses and reverberation times in octave bands that feed into the second part of the algorithm, designed to calculate the STI using the indirect method. Based on the average STI value, the tool also provides the intelligibility rating, a qualification according to a five-point scale of the quality of speech intelligibility. The block diagram of the tool is shown in Fig. 1.
